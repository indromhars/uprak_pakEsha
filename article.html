                Extroverts are often described as the life of the party. Their outgoing, vibrant nature draws people to them, and they have a hard time turning away the attention. They thrive off the interaction.
                <br><br>
                On the opposite side are introverts. These people are typically described as more reserved. They may engage in a multitude of social activities, but they need time away from others to recharge their energy.
                <br><br>
                In the 1960s, psychologist Carl Jung first described introverts and extraverts when discussing personality elements. (The term now commonly used is extroverts.) He classified these two groups based on where they found their source of energy. In short, Jung argued extroverts are energized by crowds and interaction with the external world. Introverts need alone time to recharge, and they’re often more reserved in their manners and engagement with others.
                <br><br>
                As Jung discovered, being an extrovert isn’t an all or nothing option. Instead, most people fall somewhere on a spectrum between the two polar ends. In the years since Jung’s theories first became popular, research has discovered there are genetic and hormonal reasons some people display more extroverted characteristics than others.

                An introvert is often thought of as a quiet, reserved, and thoughtful individual. They don’t seek out special attention or social engagements, as these events can leave introverts feeling exhausted and drained.
                <br><br>
                Introverts are the opposite of extroverts. Extroverts are often described as the life of a party. They seek out interaction and conversations. They aren’t one to miss a social gathering, and they thrive in the frenzy of a busy environment.
                <br><br>
                Psychologist Carl Jung described these two personality extremes back in the 1920s. He wrote that introverts and extraverts could be separated based on how they regain energy. (The term “extrovert” is now used more commonly than “extravert.”) Introverts, his basic definition said, prefer minimally stimulating environments, and they need time alone to recharge. Extroverts refuel by being with others.
                <br><br>
                However, we know now that these personality traits are not all or nothing. Introverts can have elements of extroversion in their personalities; they may like acting on stage or throwing parties. Introverts may like a little more solitude from time to time and prefer to work alone when they really need to focus.

            Ambiverts are people who have some extrovert tendencies and some introvert tendencies, says Richard Cockerill, MD, MBE, a practicing forensic psychiatrist and assistant professor of psychiatry at Northwestern University in Chicago. 
            <br><br>
            Many people find they're extroverted in certain situations, such as a gathering of family and friends, but introverted in others, like a work meeting.
            <br><br>
            Ambiverts tend to engage in middle-ground behaviors, such as preferring to go to a restaurant with a small group of friends rather than a nightclub with a large group. 
            <br><br>
            Cadence and timing of activities is also a factor, says Derickson. "[People] can lean toward the ends of the spectrum, but not all the time," she explains. "They might want to go to a busy nightclub twice a year instead of once a month, or they might need weekends of solitude, rather than weeks."
